Mirroring with Fossil and Venti</h1>

<div class='body'> <!-- ***************************** -->

The
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/3/fs"><i>fs</i>(3)</a>
device
can
be
used
to
mirror
your
fossil
and
venti
partitions
using
several
disks.
For
example,
to
setup
a
mirror
named
/dev/fs/fossil
that
is
a
RAID
of
/dev/sdC0/fossil
and
/dev/sdD0/fossil
you
need
to
<pre>
bind -a '#k' /dev
echo mirror fossil /dev/sdC0/fossil /dev/sdD0/fossil &gt;/dev/fs/ctl
</pre>

<p class='para'>
Then
you
can
run
fossil
using
/dev/fs/fossil.
It
is
better
to
setup
the
mirror
before
formatting
the
partition
and
setting
up
fossil
on
it.
</p>

<p class='para'>
If
you
already
have
a
fossil
and
want
to
add
another
disk
to
mirror
it,
you
can
setup
the
mirror
as
said
before,
with
the
original
fossil
device
(possibly
a
partition)
being
mirrored
by
the
new
disk,
start
your
fossil
and
while
you
are
using
it,
use
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/1/dd"><i>dd</i>(1)</a>
to
copy
the
fossil
device
to
the
mirror
device
or
partition.
Since
writes
go
to
all
devices
in
the
mirror
but
reads
are
performed
just
by
the
first
device
(as
long
as
it
has
no
read
errors),
the
copy
can
be
made
this
way
with
relative
safety.
Races
are
still
possible,
since
dd
might
read
a
block
from
the
fossil
device,
fossil
might
change
it
and
write
it
to
both
devices
(original
fossil
and
mirror)
and
then
dd
might
write
the
now-stale
block
to
the
mirror,
so
it's
safer
to
make
the
copy
when
fossil
(and
venti,
if
you
mirror
it)
are
idle.
This
might
require
booting
your
file
server
off
another
standalone
Plan
9
file
&amp;
cpu
server.
So,
after
the
dd
on
an
active
fossil,
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/1/cmp"><i>cmp</i>(1)</a>
the
original
and
mirror
devices
to
be
sure
that
a
race
didn't
hit
you
while
copying.
If
it
did,
repeat
the
procedure
or
make
the
copy
with
all
disks
idle.
</p>

<p class='para'>
If
you
are
using
a
standalone
fossil
system
you
need
to
set
up
devfs
to
read
the
configuration
from
a
file
located
somewhere
on
the
disk.
The
easiest
way
to
do
it
(and
the
least
error-prone)
is
to
steal
a
single-block
partition
from
the
ones
already
on
the
disk
and
to
put
the
configuration
there,
as
you
would
do
with
the
nvram
partition.
Here's
an
example:
</p>

<pre>
 # disk/prep /dev/sdC0/plan9
   ...
   swap               20482 1273392     (1252910 sectors, 611.77 MB)
   ...
 &gt;&gt;&gt; d swap
 &gt;&gt;&gt; a fscfg 20482 20483
 &gt;&gt;&gt; a swap 20483 1273392
 &gt;&gt;&gt; w
 &gt;&gt;&gt; q
 #
</pre>

<p class='para'>
(note
that
you
may
want
to
create
such
a
partition
on
each
disc
that
is
mirrored
with
devfs,
and
even
mirror
the
partition
itself,
to
make
sure
that
if
a
disk
goes
away
the
others
will
know
about
the
system's
disk
configuration)
</p>

<p class='para'>
Now
we
need
to
copy
the
devfs
configuration
to
the
new
partition.
First
zero
it
to
make
sure
there's
nothing
dangling
in
there:
</p>

<pre>
# dd -if /dev/zero -of /dev/sdC0/fscfg -count 1
</pre>

<p class='para'>
Copy
the
devfs
configuration
file
to
a
safe
place
where
you
can
modify
it,
and
prepend
'fsdev:\n'
to
the
beginning
of
it:
</p>

<pre>
# echo 'fsdev:' &gt; $home/devfs.conf
# cat /dev/fs/ctl &gt;&gt; $home/devfs.conf
</pre>

<p class='para'>
Now
your
devfs.conf
file
should
look
something
like:
</p>

<pre>
# cat devfs.conf
fsdev:
mirror fossil /dev/sdC0/fossil /dev/sdD0/fossil
#
</pre>

<p class='para'>
Copy
that
to
the
partition
where
the
configuration
will
be
stored:
</p>

<pre>
# cp devfs.conf /dev/sdC0/fscfg
</pre>

<p class='para'>
If
the
configuration
file
is
longer
than
512
bytes
you
will
need
to
create
a
bigger
partition
in
which
to
hold
it.
Repeat
the
disk/prep
part
with
as
many
blocks
as
you
need.
Note
that
devfs.c
imposes
a
hard
limit
of
1024
bytes
per
configuration.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Now
that
the
configuration
file
is
in
place,
add
a
line
to
plan9.ini,
telling
it
where
it
is:
</p>

<pre>
fsconfig=/dev/sdC0/fscfg
</pre>

<p class='para'>
You
need
to
specify
a
particular
disk,
because
devfs
isn't
started
yet,
and
/dev/fs
doesn't
exist.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Another
alternative
is
to
place
the
config
file
into
your
kernel's
/boot.
Just
add
the
path
to
your
conf
file
(eg
/usr/bootes/devfs.conf)
to
the
bootdir
section
at
the
end
of
/sys/src/9/pc/pccpuf
(or
whatever
kernel
configuration
you're
using)
and
recompile
(see
<a href="../Compiling_kernels">Compiling
kernels</a>).
Then
in
plan9.ini,
add:
</p>

<pre>
fsconfig=/boot/devfs.conf
</pre>

<p class='para'>
Now
configure
fossil
to
search
for
the
disks
in
/dev/fs/*
and
you're
ready
to
boot.
Here's
a
sample
fossil
proto
file:
</p>

<pre>
# cat flproto
fsys main config /dev/fs/fossil
fsys main open
fsys main
...
#
</pre>

<p class='para'>
Write
the
config
file
using
fossil/conf
to
the
disk
where
fossil
will
search
it
for:
</p>

<pre>
# cat flproto | fossil/conf -w /dev/fs/fossil
</pre>

<p class='para'>
And
you
should
be
set.
</p>
